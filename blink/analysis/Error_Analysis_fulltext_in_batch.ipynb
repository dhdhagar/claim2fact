       "'As the US House of Representatives was readying a new special committee to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi Libya many Democrats were arguing that continuing to probe the Sept 11 2012 attack which killed four Americans including US Ambassador Chris Stevens amounted to a political witch hunt On May 5 2014 Rep John Garamendi DCalif told MSNBC host Ed Schultz that there has already been exhaustive testimony and investigation of the incident This thing is just going on and on to boredom actually Garamendi said The Armed Services Committee actually did a hearing and the result was theres nothing here Thats obviously a great tragedy but Ed during the George W Bush period there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world Sixty people died In Karachi there was a death of one of our diplomats and those were not investigated during that period of time because it was a tragedy Readers asked us whether its true that under Bush there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world and 60 people died We turned to the Global Terrorism Database a project headquartered at the University of Maryland The database documents terrorist attacks around the world going back to the 1970s and experts told us it is the best resource available for this factcheck We searched the database for descriptions between January 2001 and January 2009 that included the term US embassy We supplemented these with a few other attacks listed in a Huffington Post opinion piece that Garamendis staff said was their main source for the claim The Huffington Post column Garamendi cited purposely didnt count any attacks in Baghdad So we decided to construct our count from scratch While Garamendi spoke of embassies and consulates we found several US diplomatic targets killed in the line of duty outside official compounds such as in convoys or their homes and we included them in our count Once we crossreferenced the attacks in the article and those in the database we narrowed down the total to 39 attacks or attempted attacks on US embassies and embassy personnel Of these 39 attacks 20 resulted in at least one fatality Our complete list is here This is higher than Garamendis claim though if you only count attacks on embassy and consular property there were 13 Garamendi also understated the number of deaths In the 20 incidents with at least one fatality the total death toll was 87 quite a few more than the 60 Garamendi cited If you only count those at embassies and consulates proper the number of deaths drops to 66 We should note that the vast majority of these deaths were not Americans We counted 63 deaths that were either of nonAmericans or of people whose nationality is unknown Another three were US civilians Another 21 were workers at the US embassy or consulate either of American or foreign nationality So using what we think is the most reasonable definition Garamendis numbers are a bit low Featured Factcheck Facebook posts stated on November 7 2021 in a Facebook post The Astroworld concert was a test run on the vaxxed because people who are injected with graphene oxide can be controlled through magnetic frequencies including music By Samantha Putterman November 8 2021 What about the implicit comparison he made between Benghazi and these previous attacks Thats a little shakier Generally the experts we contacted agreed that Garamendi was making a reasonable point that there has been a steady and comparatively overlooked series of deadly attacks on US embassies in recent years Still these experts also said there are valid reasons to treat Benghazi differently from the earlier attacks Is Benghazi different Absolutely said Daveed GartensteinRoss a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown Universitys security studies program One reason he said is that an American ambassador died in the attack which hadnt happened since the 1970s Another relevant question GartensteinRoss said is whether what happened was put to the American people in an honest manner not just with respect to the administration but also with respect to the intelligence community GartensteinRoss added that he wasnt endorsing how the Republicans go about investigating this question But he did say its a real legitimate question As always what causes the problem is not so much what happens but the response to it said Theodore R Bromund a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation If the administration had come out shortly after the attack and said Our consulate was attacked by organized Islamist forces and we will pursue these terrorists and bring them to justice one way or the other I very much doubt there would be much juice in these hearings if indeed they were being held at all Lance Janda a military historian at Cameron University agreed that Benghazi brings up important issues We probably should have had more United States forces on site or at least nearby he said And the administration had a muddled response in terms of releasing information he added Our ruling Garamendi said that during the George W Bush period there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world Sixty people died There are actually different ways to count the number of attacks especially when considering attacks on ambassadors and embassy personnel who were traveling to or from embassy property Overall we found Garamendi slightly understated the number of deadly attacks and total fatalities even using a strict definition Garamendis claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information so we rate it Mostly True Share the Facts Politifact 2 7 Politifact Rating
