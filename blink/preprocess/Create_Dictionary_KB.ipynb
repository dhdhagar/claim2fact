       "'As the U.S. House of Representatives was readying a new special committee to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, many Democrats were arguing that continuing to probe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack -- which killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens -- amounted to a political witch hunt.\\nOn May 5, 2014, Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., told MSNBC host Ed Schultz that there has already been exhaustive testimony and investigation of the incident.\\n\"This thing is just going on and on to boredom actually,\" Garamendi said. \"The Armed Services Committee actually did a hearing and the result was there’s nothing here. That’s obviously a great tragedy, but Ed, during the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died. In Karachi, there was a death of one of our diplomats, and those were not investigated during that period of time because it was a tragedy.\"\\nReaders asked us whether it’s true that under Bush, \"there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world, (and) 60 people died.\"\\nWe turned to the Global Terrorism Database, a project headquartered at the University of Maryland. The database documents terrorist attacks around the world going back to the 1970s, and experts told us it is the best resource available for this fact-check.\\nWe searched the database for descriptions between January 2001 and January 2009 that included the term \"U.S. embassy.\" We supplemented these with a few other attacks listed in a Huffington Post opinion piece that Garamendi’s staff said was their main source for the claim. The Huffington Post column Garamendi cited purposely didn\\'t count any attacks in Baghdad. So we decided to construct our count from scratch.\\nWhile Garamendi spoke of \"embassies and consulates,\" we found several U.S. diplomatic targets killed in the line of duty outside official compounds -- such as in convoys or their homes -- and we included them in our count. Once we cross-referenced the attacks in the article and those in the database, we narrowed down the total to 39 attacks or attempted attacks on U.S. embassies and embassy personnel.\\nOf these 39 attacks, 20 resulted in at least one fatality. (Our complete list is here.) This is higher than Garamendi\\'s claim, though if you only count attacks on embassy and consular property, there were 13.\\nGaramendi also understated the number of deaths. In the 20 incidents with at least one fatality, the total death toll was 87 -- quite a few more than the 60 Garamendi cited. If you only count those at embassies and consulates proper, the number of deaths drops to 66.\\nWe should note that the vast majority of these deaths were not Americans. We counted 63 deaths that were either of non-Americans or of people whose nationality is unknown. Another three were U.S. civilians. Another 21 were workers at the U.S embassy or consulate, either of American or foreign nationality.\\nSo, using what we think is the most reasonable definition, Garamendi\\'s numbers are a bit low.<ht'"

       "  'description': 'In his speech at the Democratic National Committee in Charlotte NC President Barack Obama mocked Republicans for turning to tax cuts as the solution to every problem Have a surplus Try a tax cut Deficit too high Try another Feel a cold coming on Take two tax cuts roll back some regulations and call us in the morning Obama said Now Ive cut taxes for those who need it middleclass families and small businesses But I dont believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores or pay down our deficit Obama said Obama is often accused by Republicans of raising taxes and he has raised some taxes during his presidency Hes also said that he intends to raise income tax rates for couples who make more than 250000 a year or single people who make more than 200000 a year Here were going to look at his claim to cut taxes for middleclass families and small businesses Weve been tracking all of Obamas campaign promises about taxes on our Obameter Obama has signed off on two major tax cuts for middleclass families the Making Work Pay tax credit that was part of the economic stimulus of 2009 and a temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes that went into effect in 2011 As part of the stimulus formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act single workers collected a 400 tax credit and working couples got 800 The credit didnt come in the form of a check it worked out so that most workers had about 400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks spread out over the entire year Most workers received a tax cut under that plan with the exception of some high earners The tax cuts phased out for couples who make more than 250000 or a single person making over 200000 according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center The result mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign Obama pledged tax cuts of 500 for each worker and 1000 for working couples We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted That tax cut expired at the end of 2011 But Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress Those tax cuts a temporary reduction in workers payroll taxes worth about 2 percent of total earnings expire in 2013 Again the tax cut didnt come as a check but gives workers a little more in their paychecks than they would have otherwise Obama also has passed an array of tax cuts for small businesses Eight of them were included in the stimulus the Affordable Care Act also known as the health care law and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act also known as the HIRE Act Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act signed by Obama in September of 2010 These included adding deductions for business cell phone use creating a new deduction for health care costs for the selfemployed allowing greater deductions for business startup expenses eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments and raising the small business expense limit to 500000 Three months later the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011 It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012 For more details see our previous factcheck that provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses we rated it Mostly True To be clear this doesnt mean the middleclass and small businesses havent seen any tax increases under the Obama administration We rated his campaign promise that no family making less than 250000 will see any form of tax increase as Promise Broken Obama has signed off on new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning His health care law includes a tax penalty for people who dont buy health insurance that starts in 2014 It includes hardship exemptions for people who cant find affordable policies Also under the health care law small businesses that have more than 50 employees that dont offer their employees health insurance could face fines Our ruling Obama has raised some taxes during his presidency but hes also pursued broadbased tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses We particularly give weight here to the tax cuts that were part of the stimulus and the payroll tax holiday which reduced taxes for broad swaths of the workforce Some small businesses may have been hit by new taxes that were part of Obamas health law but these would depend on the particular circumstances of each business Also there were new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning Obama said he has cut taxes for those who need it middleclass families small businesses He has but he also has raised some taxes So while his statement is accurate it lacks that additional context We rate his claim Mostly Trueht',\n",

       "  'description': 'As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have in the past sided with the NRA on some gun issues CNNs Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders alluding to an attack ad paid for by a proMartin OMalley group Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill background checks and waiting periods said the attack which first aired June 25 Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns Sanders record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire Bernie Sanders gun nut as well as conservative glee Sorry liberals Bernie Sanders is a gun nut So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act a landmark piece of gun control legislation The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks After 1998 the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks But before Brady became law it underwent many transformations Sanders elected to the House of Representatives in 1990 voted on it numerous times virtually almost always in opposition In May 1991 Sanders voted againsta version that mandated a sevenday waiting period for background checks but the bill passed in the House The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House In Nov 1991 Sanders voted against that version Though it passed in the House the Senate didnt muster enough votes The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992 After some back and forth a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period In November 1993 Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead seen by some as pointless as the technology for instant checks didnt exist at the time He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why The final compromise version of the Brady bill an interim fiveday waiting period while installing an instant background check system was passed and signed into law on Nov 30 1993 Sanders voted against it According to Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver Sanders reason for opposing the Brady bill was twofold First he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach And second he was doing his job He wasnt opposed to states having waiting periods if they wanted to The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them and Bernie voted that down Weaversaid He said he would be against waiting periods and he kept his word to the people of Vermont In April 1991 Sanders thenchief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents Bernies response is that he doesnt just represent liberals and progressives He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont Pollina said Its not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about The Green Mountain State though leftleaning has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws as well as a low homicide rate That and Sanders own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record experts told us As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues historically explained Bertram Johnson a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont He seems to support more regulation of guns than the US presently has but he recognizes his constituents preferences so does not make gun control a priority I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions which sort of walk a middle line and angering both sides through the years said Chris Graff the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians Former Vermont Gov Howard Dean whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders 2016 run received high marks from the National Rifle Association Vermont Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill For his part Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half Here are

       "  'description': 'Jerry Patterson says the fellow Republican who succeeded him as Texas land commissioner George P Bush fixed very few homes in the months since Hurricane Harvey slapped ashore in August 2017 Patterson otherwise confirming his 2018 candidacy for land commissioner a post he previously held for 12 years said in a recent interview that the Bushled General Land Office hadnt accomplished much in the way of hurricane relief On Dec 8 2017 Patterson said to Austin AmericanStatesman commentator Ken Herman I mean who the hells in charge here And now we have tens of thousands of Texans who are essentially homeless and the land office has repaired twotwo homes And weve got folks waking up that have been sleeping in tents and they got snow this morning People are still sleeping in tents Pattersons comment seemed potent given that the GLO announced in September 2017 it was teaming with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hasten postHarvey recovery in part by helping eligible survivors begin to patch up their homesthough full rebuilds werent in the mix Bush said at the time With the magnitude of the damage from Hurricane Harvey there is no doubt this will require a long recovery This agreement marks the beginning of a new model for simplifying and expediting the transition out of sheltering to shortterm and longterm housing recovery efforts We focused this factcheck on Pattersons insistence the GLO had only repaired two homes Homelessand tents But Pattersons other pokes also got our attention How many Texans remain homeless due to the hurricane is hard to pin we recently found But a University of Texas expert Gordon Wells has estimated based on flood insurance claims and satellite imagery that at the least more than 1 million Texas homes sustained flood damage though he told us that count could exceed 17 million After Patterson spoke we queried government officials about survivors in tents By phone the GLOs Pete Phillips said some Aransas County residents resistant to options such as outoftown hotels were residing in tents Similarly Bob Howard of FEMAs Harvey response team responded by email Every effort is made to ensure survivors are aware of available local state and federal resources Thus far all tentdwellers found by the field team have indicated they prefer to remain in their current status or are not eligible for federal disaster assistance Now lets turn to Pattersons focus on homes repaired with government help since Harvey and related rains flooded much of Southeast Texas Patterson points to federal program We asked Pattersonthe basis of his numerical claim he told us by phone that he was referring to two homes repaired as of early December 2017 through the federal Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair DALHR program Patterson who said hed drawn his tally of two from stateenlisted contractors and others he declined to identify urged us to seek insight from elected leaders in counties hit by Harvey We heard back from elected officials in two counties Galveston Countys county judge Mark Henry said by phone that flooding due to Harvey had flooded 22000 to 24000 local homes with water an inch to eight feet deep Henry who volunteered that hes a longtime friend to Patterson said his office daily fields calls from residents awaiting help Calling delayed repairs frustrating Henry said As far as the why repairs have been delayed Henry said I dont know and I dont care I want it to get done By email a GLO spokeswoman Brittany Eck specified that as of midDecember 2017 the agency along with FEMA had housed 56 Galveston County applicant households and 446 are in the process of receiving a direct housing solution Also by phone Loyd Neal Nueces Countys judge expressed chagrin that no agency advanced dollars enabling the Coastal Bend Council of Governments to hire individuals to consider applicants for shortterm housing help By email Eck countered that the GLO had guaranteed up to 200000 in reimbursed administrative costs to the regional councils asked to help administer postHarvey housing assistance Eck said that after the Coastal Bend council declined to participate GLO employees were carrying out the program in that region Neal told us that nearly four months since Harveys arrival FEMAfunded housing including trailers or manufactured homes had yet to be brought into Port Aransas the island tourist town where Neal elaborated more than twothirds of local hurricanedamaged condominiums had yet to reopen Its an absolute disgrace Neal said that the state of Texas and the federal government and whoever else is in charge of this have not responded Its the greatest bureaucratic buckpassing Ive ever seen By email Eck said that per FEMA in December 2017 52 Nueces County households were in need of direct housing assistance Correct count but We confirmed Pattersons count of two homes whose DALHR repair projects had been completedwith Eck and Phillips a land

       "  'description': 'One of the arguments Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price made about why substantial changes in federal health care law were needed was that the Affordable Care Act sometimes called Obamacare had failed in one of its goals to cut down on emergency room use Because emergency rooms by law cannot turn patients away they can become a health care provider of last resort even for more minor conditions that could be handled just as well and more inexpensively in a doctors office One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care and that is the emergency rooms Price said at a White House briefing on March 7 2017 In fact they did just the opposite Is Price correct that emergency room usage has gone up not down since passage of the law Our research suggests that Price has a strong case Did Obama say the law would lower emergency room use He certainly expressed hope that it would He mentioned it during an address on health care to a joint session of Congress and during a nationally televised town hall on health care on June 24 2009 During the town hall Obama said this One of the areas where we can potentially see some saving is a lot of those patients are being seen in the emergency room anyway and if we are increasing prevention if we are increasing wellness programs were reducing the amount of emergency room care then that frees up doctors and resources to provide the kind of primary care that will keep people healthier but also allow them to see more patients and hopefully give more time to patients as well Has emergency room use gone up since the law has gone into effect Different pieces of data vary somewhat but all in all theres strong evidence that emergency room usage hasnt declined much if at all since the law largely took effect in 2013 Theres also evidence that it has increased Here are some examples of studies that looked at this question May 2015 A survey of more than 2000 emergencyroom physicians by the American College of Emergency Physicians asked whether the volume of patients in their emergency room had dropped or risen after the law took effect The results 28 percent said it had increased greatly and 47 percent said it had increased slightly Combined that means threequarters of emergency room doctors saw an increase February 2016 A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the change in emergency room use between 2013 which was largely before the law and 2014 which was largely after the law took effect ER use overall has not changed significantly after the first full year of ACA implementation the report concludes August 2016 A study in the journal Annals of Emergency Medicine looked at emergency room use in Illinois by adults between 2011 and 2015 separating out patterns of visits before and after the law took effect The study found that emergency room visits in the state increased after ACA health insurance expansion A large postACA increase in Medicaid visits and a modest increase in privately insured visits outpaced a large reduction in emergency room visits by uninsured patientsht',\n",

       "  'title': 'PolitiFact Tammy Duckworth hits Mark Kirk for military embellishments',\n",
       "  'description': 'In a speech Aug 18 in Springfield Ill to the county leaders of the Illinois Democratic Party US Rep Tammy Duckworth revived and added specificity to a charge that dogged US Sen Mark Kirk throughout his successful 2010 US Senate campaign This is the man who knows so much about national security Hes been wrong about every issue on national security hes ever been involved in Duckworth said And who by the way claims all this based on his military record which he lied about at least 10 times Those who followed Kirks campaign against thenIllinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias likely recall that Kirk in 2010 issued clarifications and apologies related to his military claims on more than one occasion But at least 10 The Duckworth campaign provided a list of Kirks alleged infractions It says Kirk falsely claimed he won the Naval Intelligence Officer of the Year Award performed combat duty in Kosovo was shot at in Afghanistan and while flying over Iraq was deployed to Afghanistan took part in Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom was the only member of Congress as of 2005 who was a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom commanded the Pentagons war room and did not violate military policy about campaigning while on duty We decided to look into the allegations The background Kirk served as an intelligence officer in the US Naval Reserve from 1989 to 2013 and frequently mentioned his military experience during the years he spent as US representative for Illinois 10th Congressional District from 200111 Theres nothing unusual about that As Chicago SunTimes columnist Carol Marin noted in a June 2 2010 column In American politics military service is like a platinum credit card Kirk might have kept his platinum card status had Terry Welch an Afghanistan veteran and blogger at Nitpickercom not looked into a claim in 2005 by US Rep Jean Schmidt ROhio that Kirk was the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress Kirk became part of this narrative only as a side player Schmidt brought up Kirks service record to refute a claim by her opponent that if elected he would be the first Iraq War vet in Congress Kirks official House website at the time said Kirk is the only member of Congress to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom In a series of posts in 2005 here here and here Welch painstakingly dissected Kirks claim of Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran status Kirks office eventually changed the wording though Welch noted that it took 50 days for it to do so While we applaud the service of Mark Kirk his service occurred before the March 19 2003 start date of the mission according to the Bush administration itself Welch wrote in this post The episode though clumsily handled by Kirks office faded in the years that followed But when Kirk in 2010 became the Republican nominee for the US Senate seat previously held by Barack Obama it became a crack in a dam that soon would unleash a flood of reporting on similar incidents in which Kirk inaccurately described his military career The questions started anew in May 2010 when Kirks opponent thenIllinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias challenged Kirks claim to have been named Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year in 1999 This led to an admission by Kirk that he had not won the award but was part of a unit that won a different honor Commander Danny Hernandez a Navy spokesman said Thursday the individual 1999 Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer of the Year was given to another reservist and not to Kirk the Chicago Tribune reported Also around that time Kirk changed his website to remove the word combat from his description of military service in Kosovo On June 3 Kirk faced new allegations of embellishment when he visited the Chicago Tribune editorial board From the Tribunes report In a new disclosure Kirk acknowledged that his campaigns promotion of him coming under fire while flying aboard an intelligence reconnaissance plane in Iraq may not be correct because there is no record of whether his aircraft was being fired upon Kirk also acknowledged a constituent letter sent out by his North Shore congressional district office last year that described him as a member of Operation Desert Storm though he did not participate in that effort I am sorry absolutely Kirk said You should speak with utter precision You should stand on the documented military record In public discourse for high office you should make sure that there is a degree of complete rigorous precession If youre keeping score thats six of the 10 On June 13 the Tribune ran a story challenging Kirks claim that he had been deployed to Afghanistan when really he had been there for short training stints The article again quoted Navy spokesman Commander Danny Hernandez A deployment is a deployment and annual training is annual training Hernandez said Thats No 7 On July 8 2010 PolitiFact summarized more inaccuracies in Kirks telling of his military background These found Kirk claiming incorrectly that he had served in Operation Desert Storm and that he commanded the war room in the Pentagon PolitiFact mentioned those and other incidents while testing the veracity of a claim by Kirks opponent that Kirk had been disciplined for violating Pentagon rulesfor improperly mingling politics with his military serviceht',\n",

       "  'description': 'A Democrat credited the Republican governor for highlighting maternal mortality and then made a claim about Texas leading nationallyin a disturbingway Houston Rep Shawn Thierry noted in a press releasecirculated the day after Gov Greg Abbott set the agenda for the special legislative session starting July 18 2017 that Abbott authorized maternal mortality as a potential topic after Thierry and Sen Lois Kolkhorst RBrenham had urged him to do so Thierry said It was clear that a special session was going to happen and we now know that our Texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation This time around we cannot afford for party politics to stand in the way of resolving this crisis Abbott included extending maternal mortality task force in his session call he said to allow lawmakers to maintain the states advisory Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force into 2023 The group created by the 2013 Legislature is otherwise abolished as of September 2019 We wondered if Texas mothers are more often dying in connection with childbirth than mothers in other states Thats been reported previously including in a June 4 2017 Associated Press news story stating researchers last year found the Texas rate not only the highest in the US but one of the highest in the developed world To our inquiry a Thierry aide Jasmine Connor emailed us a web link to an August 2016 news story in the Guardian newspaper stating that according to a study in the medical journal Obstetrics and Gynecology Texas in 2014 had the developed worlds highest maternal mortality rate at 358 deaths per 100000 births The journal is the official publication of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which describes itself as a 58000member organization dedicated to the advancement of womens health 2016 study When we inquired an ACOG spokeswoman Megan Christin emailed us a copy of the study which appeared in the journals September 2016 issue under the headline Recent Increases in the US Maternal Mortality Rate Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues A methodological wrinkle was necessary the authors wrote to make sure the mortality rates estimated for each state reflected needed improvements in measurement That is the study adjusted each states tally of maternal deaths to account for whether the states death certificate already included a revealing question devised nationally in 2003 based on providing checkboxes on death certificates to measure whether women had been pregnant at up to a year before death Adding the question the study says drove up reported maternal mortality rates The addition of this question led to increases in reported maternal mortality rates the study says However delays in states adoption of the new pregnancy question together with use of nonstandard pregnancy questions created a situation where in any given data year some states were using the US standard question others were using questions incompatible with the US standard and still others had no pregnancy question on their death certificates Broadly the study relied on a definition of maternal mortality typically used for international maternal mortality comparisons The definition attributed to the World Health Organization The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes The study says though the WHO also defines late maternal deaths The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than 1 year after termination of pregnancy Study Texas saw a spike So did Texas have the nations highest maternal mortality The state had a yettobe explained spike in rates in 201112 the study says giving it by far the highest rate in the country Previously adjusted maternal mortality rates for Texas showed a modest increase from 2000 to 2010 the study says from a rate of 177 per 100000 livebirths to 186 However after 2010 the reported maternal mortality rate for Texas doubled within a 2year period to levels not seen in other US states the report says A figure in the study shows the Texas rate reaching 358 deaths per 100000 livebirths by 2014 ADJUSTED MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE TEXAS 20002014 SOURCE Figure 4 in study Recent Increases in the US Maternal Mortality Rate Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues Obstetrics amp Gynecology September 2016 The report also calls the twoyear doubling for Texas through 201112 puzzling The authors continue Texas causeofdeath data as with data for most states are coded at the National Center for Health Statistics and this doubling in the rate was not found for other states Communications with vital statistics personnel in Texas and at the National Center for Health Statistics did not identify any data processing or coding changes that would account for this rapid increase The report continues There were some changes in the provision of womens health services in Texas from 2011 to 2015 including the closing of several womens health clinics Still in the absence of war natural disaster or severe economic upheaval the doubling of a mortality rate within a 2year period in a state with almost 400000 annual births seems unlikely A future study will examine Texas data by raceethnicity and detailed causes of death to better understand this unusual finding Among 48 other states the estimated mortality rate in 2000 was 188 the rate escalated slowly to 238 in 2014 the report says The remaining state California saw a marked decline in maternal and late maternal mortality from 2003 to 2014 the study says going on California has made concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality including initiating a statewide pregnancyassociated mortality review in 2006 and contracting with the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative to investigate primary causes of maternal death This collaborative developed and promulgated evidencebased tool kits to address two of the most common preventable contributors to maternal death obstetric hemorrhage and preeclampsia and implemented quality improvement initiatives throughout the state These efforts appear to have helped reduce maternal mortality in California the study says Texas expert We were unable to connect with authors of the study including lead analyst Marian F MacDorman of the Maryland Population Research Center at the University of Maryland College Park Meantime Christin put us in touch with Dr Lisa Hollier ACOGs presidentelect and the chair of the 15person Texas task force focused on maternal mortality Hollier a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a maternalfetal medicine specialist said by phone the 2012 Texas spike identified in the study was unusual even strange In 2014 Hollier said the task force began a casebycase review of the 2012 deaths she said because that was then the latest year of complete death data We asked Hollier if the 2012 spike seems to hold up Hollier said We need a tiny bit more time to give a perfect answer to that with conclusions possibly announced later in 2017 Asked to assess Thierrys claim about Texas leading the nation in deaths in childbirth which arguably would overlook deaths in the months after delivery Hollier said by email As I considered this question I believe that the proportion of all maternal deaths that occur literally in childbirth would be largely equivalent across states Given the high rates of maternal mortality in Texas relative to other states I believe this would mean that deaths in childbirth would also be high in Texas relative to other states State agency response We also wondered if Texas government officials had analyzed the research suggesting Texas lately has the nations highest maternal mortality rate At the Texas Department of State Health Services spokesman Chris Van Deusen replied to our query by email by saying the agency doesnt have data for other states or do related rankings Van Deusen otherwise confirmed that officials are looking into what appears to have been a pronounced difference in Texas women in 2012 dying in childbirth or within a year afterward Van Deusen said that to date the task force had found the most common causes of maternal death in 20112012 were cardiac events 21 percent drug overdoses 12 percent and hypertensioneclampsia 11 percent The task forces July 2016 report states Cardiac events and hypertensioneclampsia were ranked first and third most common causes of maternal death which is consistent with medical literature However overdose by ingestion of drugs emerged as the second leading cause of maternal death in 20112012 116 percent Review of actual case records including postmortem toxicology and police reports showed that the majority of these maternal deaths involved licit or illicit prescription opioids This finding is alarming and may represent an ongoing shift in maternal causes of death Also of concern the task force said was the number of maternal deaths that occurred months after delivery Close to 60 percent of Texas maternal deaths 20112012 occurred after 42 days postdelivery the task force wrote Case review of these deaths will determine whether they were pregnancyrelated associated or neither Nevertheless it is clear that women remain atrisk for the first year after their pregnancy has ended It is possible that lack of continuity of care plays a role in these later maternal death outcomes In June 2017 Van Deusen wrote us Maternal deaths have been increasing in Texas at the same time we have seen increases in the chronic diseases that underlie many deaths from 2005 to 2014 prepregnancy obesity of mothers increased 25 percent hypertension increased 20 percent and diabetes increased 45 percent The state official also provided a chart suggesting that in 2014 126 or 135 maternal deaths were reported in Texas giving the state a rate of 315 or 338 maternal deaths per 100000 livebirths according to respective counts by DSHS and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with both rates a decrease from 2013 and the CDCreported rate down 13 percent from the 387 deaths per 100000 livebirths posted for 2012ht',\n",

       "  'description': 'As the Syrian civil war rages on the refugee crisis was a major subject of debate at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York last month Many nations remain suspicious of refugees from the Middle East fearful that some may be terrorists or criminals In a speech to the Leaders Summit on Refugees on Sept 20 President Barack Obama strongly pushed back against this suspicion He made an impassioned argument for countries to increase humanitarian aid to conflict zones and accept their fair share of refugees In recent years in the United States weve worked to put in intensive screening and security checks so we can welcome refugees and ensure our security In fact refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist he said Officials at government agencies have made similar statements saying that refugees are subject to the most intense screening of any visitors to the UnitedStates His claim comes at a time when politicians such as Donald Trump are casting doubt on the governments ability to vet refugees and make sure they dont pose a threat to the country We were interested in comparing the screening process for tourists and refugees to see whether Obamas claim is correct Comparing the protocols We first looked at the Department of Homeland Securitys official protocols for tourist and refugee screening and outlined the major components of each one below First travelers from 38 countries such as the UK Australia and Japan can apply for the visa waiver program This allows them to travel to the UnitedStatesfor 90 days or less without applying for a visa Applicants must have passports with special security features and need to obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization an automated screening system for passengers Visitors that dont apply for a visa waiver need to apply for a visitors visa Prospective visitors need to have a valid passport resume and photo ID in order to complete the DS160 which is the major online nonimmigrant visa application They also need to pass a visa interview where theyre often asked to provide evidence of their trips purpose For example a visiting scientist may have to bring a document proving that they will attend a research symposium in the United States The waiting time to obtain a visitors visa depends on the travelers country of origin but typically takes between several weeks to several months A visitors visa usually lasts six months but can be extended through an additional application process The listed screening process for refugees is more complicated and frequently takes at least two years to complete According to the White Houses website refugees are first identified assessed and interviewed by UNHCR the United Nations refugee agency Applicants then go through a strict screening process while still overseas They face security checks and interviews with at least four federal agencies such as the FBI and the State Department The Department of Homeland Security then interviews the candidate again with specially trained officers from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Servicesht',\n",

coming to our graduate and undergraduate programs and invited speakers declining to come when they realized that we couldnt guarantee that they would give their talk in a gunfree space Concrete examples is definitive So how about details First its worth noting that since 1995 Texas law has allowed any individual with a concealed handgun permit to carry a gun on public college and university sidewalks streets parking areas and other grounds In 2015 state lawmakers widened the law by voting to let permit holders also carry guns in campus buildings except in areas excluded under rules adopted by each schools president UTAustin President Gregory L Fenves has written that he doesnt believe handguns belong in campus buildings still he agreed to allow them in classrooms because he said barring them would have the effect of generally excluding guns from campus which the law prohibits In February 2016 Fenves also wrote Bill McRaven the UT System chancellor Since this is a new law with an unknown effect on UT Austin we will monitor implementation and its impact on students faculty members and staffers I have significant concerns about how the law will affect our ability to recruit and retain faculty members and students Fenves is among state defendants too in a lawsuit filed by Moore and two fellow professors seeking to bar civilian handguns from campus On Aug 22 2016 a federal judge denied their request for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed them to ban concealed handguns from their classrooms US District Judge Lee Yeakel said he found no precedent for the argument that professors have a right of academic freedom under the First Amendment so broad that it overrides decisions of the Legislature and the university that employs them Moore Jennifer Lynn Glass and Mia Carter were still free to pursue the merits of their case But Yeakels ruling was a considerable setback for them as they wanted to ban guns in time for the start of fall classes Virginia

to the gun law A February 2016 Austin AmericanStatesman news blog post quoted Siva Vaidhyanathan a University of Virginia professor of media studies whod previously earned UT bachelors and doctoral degrees saying hed been contacted by a search firm helping the university find a dean for the Moody College of Communicationand the story said was later told he was a finalist But the gun law weighed on him the story said that if chosen Vaidhyanathan said hed have felt compelled to side with faculty members seeking to bar guns from classrooms I would probably be fired immediately he said I told the search firm I was no longer interested in the position To our inquiry Vaidhyanathan provided a December 2015 email he sent to search firm officials declining their invitation to return to the Texas campus for an extended visit and a dinner about the deanship that would have included meetings with Fenves and others Vaidhyanathans email said the prospect of guns being allowed in classrooms meant he couldnt pursue this position with enthusiasm Vaidhyanathan wrote I could not in good conscience ask faculty and students to put themselves into an environment in which students visitors or even faculty could be armed My wife is a scientist I could not ask her to take a job at a university that was forbidden by law to restrict guns from classrooms The very consideration of that possibility puts a chilling effect on open and relaxed discourse in the classroom And the fact that the university cannot restrict guns on campus in general means that university police officers are forbidden to do their jobs effectively They cant diffuse a threatening situation until it becomes a dangerous one Universities are tense enough already And we all count on our university police forces to confront and defuse threatening situations as early as possible The State of Texas has put every student and professor in Texas in danger I applaud the chancellor the president the faculty and the students for their strong opposition to campus carry So thats a candidate for dean confirmed Next we followed up with Moore about particular students other prospective faculty and speakers deciding not to come to UT due to the gun law A mothers email Moore forwarded a November 2015 email sent by a parent Rachel Zucker to a UT mailbox The message says Dear UT I want you to know that my son Moses Goren is a straight A student at Hunter College High School in NYC who has expressed interest in applying to your Plan II program at UT Austin He and I have decided however that he will not apply to any schools that have campus carry laws We believe that guns should not be allowed on college campuses and that guns present a serious physical danger for faculty and students If you were to make UT Austin a safer place by making it illegal to bring a gun on campus I would eagerly and proudly have Moses apply to your esteemed school Thank you Rachel Zucker To our inquiry Zucker confirmed her sons decision Both of us feel even clearer about this than we did when wrote that email The rampant gun violence and lack of commonsense gun control in this country should be a source of unmitigated shame for our leaders and legislators Zucker said by email adding that she hopes UT bans guns on campus Moore also noted the departures of two UT faculty members by 2016 In each instance Architecture Dean Frederick Steiners move to the University of Pennsylvania and economist Daniel Hamermeshs shift to opportunities abroad news stories and emails we fielded from the men describe the gun law as a factor though not the only factor in the departuresht',\n",

       "  'description': 'Mitt Romneys pick of US Rep Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare Ryan RWis is the head of the Budget Committee in the US House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare Today Medicare operates as a governmentrun health insurance plan for Americans over age 65 Ryans idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now and it would give them voucherlike credits to buy traditional feeforservice Medicare or competing private insurance plans The credits are sometimes called premium support Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryans plan polling shows public opinion is mixed with older voters the most wary of the plan The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back saying President Barack Obama has cut 700 billion out of Medicare And the Democratic response to that Well Paul Ryan cuts that amount too For this check were looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom You know I heard Mitt Romney deride the 700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform Cutter said You know what those cuts are Its taking subsidies away from insurance companies taking rebates away from prescription drug company Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget Its a lot to digest if youre not already a Medicare policy wonk so let us sort it out for you For now we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them cuts a claim were checking in another item and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget 700 billion in Medicare cuts Because were wonks ourselves at PolitiFact our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut 700 billion out of Medicare Just a few weeks ago the oftcited number was 500 billion How did he manage to cut another 200 billion when no one was looking Well there are cuts and then there are CUTS Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar from the Medicare programs budget Rather the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs At the time the law was passed those reductions amounted to 500 billion over the next 10 years What kind of spending reductions are we talking about They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals not beneficiaries The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers Medicare Advantage was started under President George W Bush and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers Hospitals too will be paid less if they have too many readmissions or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care Still the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future The health care law tries to limit that growth making it less than it would have been without the law but not reducing its overall budget So claims that Obama would cut Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate In the past weve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False depending on the wording and context Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year the costsaving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger Also it takes a few years for the health care laws savings mechanisms to kick in In fact the effects of time are the main reason the 500 billion number has turned into 700 billion The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by 507 billion between 2012 and 2021 In a more recent estimate released this year the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by 716 billion So its timing thats making the cuts bigger not changes to Medicare Does the Ryan budget protect those cuts Now onto our second question Does Ryans budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending The short answer is yes Heres what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June before his selection as Romneys running mate Stephanopoulos You know several independent factcheckers have taken a look at that claim the 500 billion in Medicare cuts and said that its misleading And in fact by that accounting your budget your own budget which Gov Romney has endorsed would also have 500 billion in Medicare cuts Ryan Well our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare Read the full exchange So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutters remarks and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law including the savings for Medicare Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare ending President Obamas 716 billion raid on Medicare and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces said Lanhee Chen Romneys policy director in a statement reported by NBC News A RomneyRyan administration will restore the funding to Medicare ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations Cutter though was talking about the Ryan budget We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesnt have the force of law And its plan for Medicare hasnt been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office Still Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law Thats because both sides agree on one point Medicare spending is growing too rapidly and it needs to reined in Our ruling Cutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting 700 billion out of Medicare but Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget Again with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryans planht',\n",

       "  'description': 'Congress headed home for its sixweek preelection break on Sept 22 after the US Senate voted just past midnight to give final approval to a shortterm budget measure that will keep the federal government running for another six months The decision to approve a shortterm budget fix instead of passing a spending plan for the entire fiscal year that begins Oct 1 again set off a debate about whether lawmakers were acting irresponsibly We havent passed a budget in more than three years and not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the floor this year US Sen Bob Corker RTenn said in a press release explaining why he voted against the shortterm measure Corker argued Congress should not be passing the shortterm measure known as a continuing resolution or any spending bill until it has prioritized how taxpayer dollars are to be spent and at what levels If the Senate cant perform its most basic responsibilities Corker said I worry about how were going to make the tough decisions and do the hard work that will be necessary to get our country on a path to fiscal solvency To back up the senators claim about congressional inaction on a budget and spending bills Corkers office pointed us to two documents compiled by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee The first was a timeline indicating that the last time the Democraticled Senate passed a budget was on April 29 2009 The other document was a status report on all 12 of the annual spending bills that provide funding for federal departments and agencies According to that document not one of the 12 spending bills has been considered by the full Senate this year Corker is not the first Republican to take the Democraticled Senate to task for failing to pass a budget PolitiFact and its partners in other states have examined at least five similar claims in the past and rulings on those have varied because the statements were worded differently When statements attempted to pin the blame squarely on just one political party for the inaction rulings of Half True were given But in a case where blame was not heaped on just one party as is the case with Corkers statement PolitiFact has gone with True or Mostly True depending on the wording of the claim In any case each of those statements cited the same date April 29 2009 as the last time a budget had been approved An April 26 2012 item from PolitiFact Ohio explained how the budget process is supposed to work Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring These budget resolutions set a framework for spending taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year They also lay out general plans for the next four years If these budget resolutions differ the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise Budget resolutions are policy plans They are not appropriations bills or spending bills which actually allocate money for specific purposes If a budget resolution doesnt pass the federal government wont go dark In the absence of a budget resolution appropriations bills have continued to allocate money What about Corkers claim that not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the Senate floor this year The US House passed seven of the 12 annual appropriations bills this year and sent them to the Senate for consideration according to the status report by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved 11 of the 12 spending bills and sent them to the full Senate for consideration An independent search by PolitiFact via the Library of Congress Thomas billtracking web site confirmed the figures cited in the GOP report But none of the bills approved by the House or the Senate Appropriations Committee were ever brought to the Senate floor for a vote Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid DNev who decides which bills will be considered told reporters on July 10 2012 that no spending bills were likely to be approved this year because of an ongoing dispute with House Republicans over how much the federal government should spend True to his word Reid so far has not brought any of the annual spending bills to the floor this year necessitating the shortterm budget measure to keep the government running for another six months Previous PolitiFact items on claims like this also have brought this perspective there have been times when Republicans have been in charge and also have failed to pass a budget Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida report that the House and the Senate had failed to pass a joint budget bill on four other occasions since 1983 For fiscal year 2003 the Senate under Democratic control in 2002 failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind For fiscal years 1999 2005 and 2007 the House and the Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure In these latter three cases the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress Our ruling Sen Corker says it has been more than three years since Congress passed a budget and that this year not a single appropriations bill has made it the Senate floor The record shows that he has his facts straight While other Republicans have tried to lay the blame for the lack of a budget at the feet of Democrats Corker does not specifically apportion blame just one party He simply chastised the Senate in general for failing to pass a budget and we rate his statement as True ht',\n",

       "  'description': 'Income inequality is the core issue of Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and he said it may also be why hes behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders why he thought 16 of 17 states with large wealth gaps were won by Clinton Well because poor people dont vote I mean thats just a fact Sanders said Thats a sad reality of American society And thats why we have to transform one as you know one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major society of Earth We have done a good job of bringing young people But in America today the last election in 2014 80 percent of poor people did not vote Is turnout among the poor really that low The data shows that weve done slightly better at getting out the vote among lowincome people than what Sanders suggests but not by much Sanders policy director Warren Gunnels pointed us to a report by the leftleaning policy and advocacy group Demos which used data from the Census Bureau According to Demos only one in four of those earning less than 10000 voted in 2014 Gunnels said Even worse the turnout was just 12 percent among 18 to 24yearolds earning less than 30000 In other words roughly 75 percent of people in the lowest income bracket didnt vote in the last midterm elections However theres one catch to this figure While an annual income of less than 10000 is undoubtedly poor the poverty threshold in 2014 also includes family incomes above 10000 Sean McElwee a policy analyst with Demos who authored the report told us to look at annual incomes under 30000 instead The turnout rate for that group was 315 percent which means 685 percent of poor people didnt vote in 2014 about 10 percentage points less than what Sanders said Sanders is indeed correct to highlight low turnout among the poor as an important factor that biases policy in favor of the wealthy McElwee said As PolitiFact has reported census data may overstate the turnout rates as its based on selfreporting So its possible that Sanders 80 percent figure is closer to actual rates than what the survey shows but this is speculative Sanders is more on target if we look at a definition of poor that is not based on income A 2015 Pew Center survey looked at the politics of financial security which analysts defined as having a credit card a savings or checking account and a retirement or investment plan not needing to borrow money not falling behind on bills rent or mortgage payments and not receiving food assistance or Medicaid benefitsht',\n",

       "  'description': 'Republicans promised that their tax overhaul would save money for the middle class and Rep Markwayne Mullin ROkla was quick to make the case that it did Im working alongside the White House and other members in the House to lessen the tax burden that currently weighs on so many Oklahomans Mullin posted on his congressional blog Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the average American family of four will receive a 1182 tax cut Imagine what you could do with 1182 more in your pocket Mullins talking point has been popular among House Republicans trying to sell the tax plan In the past week weve heard House Speaker Paul Ryanand a Georgia congressman tout the same figure In each case they overstated the impact of the tax cut Mullin did too but less so Heres what you need to know The figure comes from the House Ways and Means Committee which wrote the tax billThat committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposals changes could affect different types of taxpayers The key elements in the committeescalculation involve tax brackets the standard deduction and the child tax credit Currently there are seven brackets these would be consolidated into four 12 percent 25 percent 35 percent and 396 percent In the meantime the standard deduction would be raised from 12000 to 24000 And the child tax credit will be increased from 1000 to 1600 bolstered by a new 300 credit for parents and other dependents The example Mullin highlighted refers to a family of four making 59000 per year Heres the scenario outlined in the Houses fact sheet using the fictional example of Steve and Melinda with two middle schoolaged children As a result of lower tax rates a significantly larger standard deduction and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit Steve and Melinda will pay over 1182 less in taxes than last year reducing their total tax bill from 1582 to only 400 Thats more money they can use for whatever is important to them whether its paying bills purchasing a new refrigerator or putting away savings for the future The Ways and Means Committee said they chose a household income of 59000 because its the median household income nationally Mullin talked about families and families are not identical to households but in Oklahoma the median family income is about 58000 so the distinction makes little difference in his state For that amount of income a family today would get 12700 from the standard deduction 16200 in personal exemptions leaving 30100 in taxable income Of that 18650 would be taxed at 10 percent and 11450 would be taxed at 15 percent meaning the preliminary tax liability would be 358250 That would be adjusted with 2000 in child tax credits producing a final tax liability of 158250 Under the new tax bill the family would take a larger 24000 standard deduction the proposal eliminates personal exemptions leaving 35000 in taxable income At the 12 percent rate that would mean 4200 in preliminary liability This would be offset by 3200 in child tax credits and 600 in family credits leaving a final tax liability of 400 Thats a 118250 tax cut So the number adds up but there are some caveats that show it might not work out this way for all families like Steve and Melindasht',\n",

       "  'description': 'State lawmakers are fresh off a legislative session in which they passed sweeping health care reforms But Jennifer Williamson a candidate running to represent House District 36 isnt content with just those changes In a mailer shes sent to potential voters shes promised to fight for a singlepayer system Whats more she knows how shed fund it Heres what she says Jennifer Williamson will work to implement a single statewide publicly funded plan that covers everyone in our state Jennifer knows this doesnt have to cost more because onethird of our healthcare dollars go to wasteful insurance billing and bureaucracy that could be eliminated with a universal publiclyfunded plan There is a lot there way more than we can get to in one fact check and much of it is hypothetical There are estimates about how much a singlepayer system would cost for example but theres not a clear consensus So were going to drill down into this idea that nearly a third of our dollars go to bureaucracy and billing First heres a little health care primer In the insurance industry theres something called a medical loss ratio You might have heard this term back when the health care reform legislation was making its way through Congress Basically the medical loss ratio describes the percent of every dollar that an insurance company takes in that goes to medical costs So for instance if a company has a 70 percent medical loss ratio that means that 70 cents of every dollar goes to health care while 30 cents goes to other areas administration advertising and profit for example Under the new federal healthcare law the ratio must be 80 percent or insurance companies have to rebate the overage With that out of the way lets get to what we heard from the Williamson campaign Spokeswoman Tera Pierce pointed us to several articles on the subject of medical loss ratios Perhaps the most central to the mailers argument was one out of the New England Journal of Medicine called Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada by Steffie Woolhandler Terry Campbell and David Himmelstein Campbell comes from the Canadian Institute for Health Information Woolhandler and Himmelstein from the Cambridge Hospital and Harvard Medical School That study found that after exclusions administration accounted for 310 percent of health care expenditures in the United State The campaign encouraged us to speak with Dr Sam Metz a physician who is both an advocate for Williamson and for a single payer system Metz noted and well come back to this in a minute that the average medical loss ratio in the United States is about 80 percent But the reason this study tacks on another 11 percent is that the medical loss ratio does not take into account the cost of physicians to collect from insurance companies When you consider that end of the supply chain or at least when this study did the amount of cash flowing toward administrative costs increases Now its worth noting that this study advocated for a single payer system after comparing the US to Canada Its also worth noting that the study is not without its critics Health care after all is a very hot issue With all that in mind we called Dr Jeff Luck a professor of health management and policy at Oregon State University Luck was less bully on the WoolhandlerCampbell study Thirty percent is an overstatement I think Luck said There are some proponents of a singlepayer health care system that I think overstate the contribution of administration in insurance What about the added costs to doctor offices and other providers Thats probably a fair statement that physicians and hospitals spend money because of the complexity of the US insurance system he said But I think even adding the insurance costs putting the costs at 30 percent is overstatement Now this is all a game of extrapolation And were not health care experts For a clearer understanding we decided to dig up Oregons numbers especially given that Williamson is talking about a statewide plan This is where things get a little murkier See while Oregon might not have the best school system and while we might have skyhigh unemployment we do manage to keep our insurance industry lean We spoke with Cheryl Martinis a spokeswoman for the Oregon Insurance Division The amount of money going to administrative costs varies widely depending on the market Nationally large private insurers that provide coverage through employers see about 12 percent of their intake going to nonmedical expenses But if you look at the individual market those can skyrocket to 30 sometimes 40 percent Medicares overhead meanwhile is usually put somewhere around 2 or 3 percent though some argue thats a superficially low estimate Ezra Klein over at the Washington Post has a really nice primer on this for those interested in reading more All that said Oregons overall medical loss ratio is around 89 percent according to the Insurance Division Put another way in 2011 about 89 cents of every insurance dollar in Oregon went to medical costs Only 2 cents went to profits Now Oregon is in a unique place because not only is our insurance market highly competitive in the Portland area where the vast majority of Oregonians live but two of our biggest insurers Providence and Kaiser are also providers That means they can cut through administrative costs easily Theyre also notforprofit So where does that leave us Well Williamson says that about 30 percent of our health care dollars goes to administrative costs and other bureaucracy There is a peerreviewed study that backs this up even if its not the final word She was also careful not to say that 30 percent of our insurance dollars go to administrative costs and bureaucracy just that 30 percent of our health care dollars did Its true that one professor we spoke to was skeptical of this study but it was published in a reputable journal and moreover even that professor felt that it was appropriate to tack on the added administrative costs the provider incurs The campaign also cited other studies that suggest providers incur considerable costs in their administrative dealings with insurance companies Oregons health care industry is leaner than the national average and if Williamson is talking about a statewide singlepayer system which is really the only sort she could conceivably impact in the position for which she is running that is important context She wouldnt be able to wring as much out of administrative costs in Oregon as she could nationally As for the final ruling well give this statement a Mostly True Its accurate but we think that voters might want additional information about statewide performanceht',\n",

       "  'description': 'The blockbuster article in the Washington Post saying President Donald Trump had revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting didnt just put the White House on the defensive It also put Republican lawmakers in a tight spot One of the members of Congress who commented after the newspapers revelations was Sen James Risch RIdaho According to CNN he told reporters The minute the president speaks about it to someone he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process Is that accurate Independent experts said Risch is on target concerning the legal powers of the president Some experts added however that the senators formulation left out some context that is relevant for assessing Trumps alleged actions The presidents classification and declassification powers are broad Experts agreed that the president as commanderinchief is ultimately responsible for classification and declassification When someone lower in the chain of command handles classification and declassification duties which is usually how its done its because they have been delegated to do so by the president directly or by an appointee chosen by the president The majority ruling in the 1988 Supreme Court case Department of Navy vs Egan which addressed the legal recourse of a Navy employee who had been denied a security clearance addresses this line of authority The President after all is the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States according to Article II of the Constitution the courts majority wrote His authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant Steven Aftergood director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy said that such authority gives the president the authority to classify and declassify at will In fact Robert F Turner associate director of the University of Virginias Center for National Security Law said that if Congress were to enact a statute seeking to limit the presidents authority to classify or declassify national security information or to prohibit him from sharing certain kinds of information with Russia it would raise serious separation of powers constitutional issues The official documents governing classification and declassification stem from executive orders But even these executive orders arent necessarily binding on the president The president is not obliged to follow any procedures other than those that he himself has prescribed Aftergood said And he can change those Indeed the controlling executive order has been rewritten by multiple presidents The current version of the order was issued by President Barack Obama in 2009 The nationalsecurity experts at the blog Lawfare wrote in the wake of the Posts revelation that the infamous comment by President Richard Nixon that when the president does it that means that it is not illegal is actually true about some things Classified information is one of them The nature of the system is that the president gets to disclose what he wants Two caveats So Rischs comment holds water when it comes to the extent of the presidents powers But some experts said that Rischs formulation leaves out some notable aspects of the particular case involving Trump The first caveat While Trump has the power to declassify information he doesnt appear to have done that in this case at least at the time the story broke Theres no question that the president has broad authority to declassify almost anything at any time without any process but thats not what happened here said Stephen I Vladeck professor at the University of Texas School of Law He did not in fact declassify the information he shared with the Russians which is why the Washington Post did not publish that informationht',\n",

       "  'description': 'Supporters of Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders are furious over the results of Nevadas state Democratic Party convention in Las Vegas Sanders supporters loudly protested both during and after the convention which saw Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton officially claim 20 pledged delegates to Sanders 15 Nevadas delegate allocation process is complex but Sanders supporters have accused the state Democratic Party of various crimes including ignoring attempts to change the rules rigging the process in favor of Clinton and disqualifying several dozen delegates that supported Sanders Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver reiterated those concerns during a May 18 interview on CNN with John Vause There was a horrendous breakdown where the leadership there in Nevada hijacked the process on the floor created a tremendous amount of angst among people who were there attending the convention who were supporters of Sen Sanders by ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do he said Theres little disagreement that the convention was chaotic PolitiFact Nevada was at the convention and saw it firsthand But does the Sanders campaigns complaints have merit What was at stake Nevadas presidential caucuses were held back in February which saw Clinton defeat Sanders by a roughly 5 percent margin among the roughly 80000 voters who participated But Nevadas process of allocating delegates isnt so cut and dried as PolitiFact has previously explained Only 23of the states 43 delegates are officially locked in as a result of the February caucuses Clinton won 13 of that pool while Sanders won 10 Another group of eight are socalled superdelegates who arent bound to any candidate and independently decide who to support Five currently support Clinton and one backs Sanders in Nevada That leaves 12 delegates technically up for grabs at the state convention in May That number is made up of five pledged party leader and elected official delegates and seven atlarge delegates awarded proportionally so whichever campaign has the majority at the state convention wins the oddnumbered delegate from those two groups Barring a total collapse from either campaign this means that one candidate was to get seven delegates at the state convention and the other was to get five As PolitiFact wrote in April the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus But that model was essentially broken during the April county conventions where less than half of Clintons allocated county delegates showed up leading Sanders to declare a surprise victory and allocated delegate advantage over Clinton 2124 to 1792 heading into the state convention Convention confusion Tensions were already mounting in the weeks before the convention with a small group of Sanders supporters filing a lawsuit against the state party which was dismissed by a Las Vegas judge and creating a petition demanding the convention rules be changed The fight over rules had been going on since April according to an email chain posted by Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston between Sanders superdelegate Erin Bilbray and party chairwoman Roberta Lange Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules which have been largely the same since 2008 gave an unfair amount of power to Lange the convention chair The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates The rules which can be read here also state that any amendment attempts must be approved by twothirds of the convention delegates which would be difficult given the nearly even number of Clinton and Sanders backers present Sanders backers say the continuing nature of the presidential primary necessitated more rule changes The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment In a previousstatement the campaign detailed several allegations of misconduct from the state party which we considered as part of this factcheckAt that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place the campaignsaid in that statement However there were no last minute rule changes sprung on conventiongoers the rules had been publicly available weeks in advance largely unchanged for three presidential cycles and given to both campaigns The first major fight happened in the morning with the convention being gaveled in nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled 9 am start time In a voice vote Lange approved adoption of a preliminary credentials report showing more Clinton than Sanders delegates Immediate howls of protests from the Sanders contingent emerged many of whom rushed the dais and started screaming insults and obscenities directly at Lange Although several videos from the event appear to have louder nays than yeas both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room And trying to determine the outcome of a voice vote from a video of around 3000 delegates is somewhat arbitrary to begin with The only person with authority to call for a different voting mechanism is the convention chair Lange Regardless upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage hurling obscenities at Lange and other members of the partys executive board and booing over remarks from California Sen Barbara Boxer delivered on behalf of the Clinton campaignht',\n",

       "  'description': 'Throughout the Oct 4 vice presidential debate Democratic candidate Tim Kaine repeatedly baited his Republican opponent Mike Pence to defend Donald Trumps controversial remarks In one instance Kaine criticized Trumps position on nuclear proliferation Kaine claimed Trump said more nations should get nuclear weapons Try to defend that Pence responded Well he never said that senator He has absolutely said it Kaine said Saudi Arabia South Korea Japan Trumps stated positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory so we decided to lay them out for you here But reading through these exchanges its clear that Trump thinks it might not be such a bad thing if South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons given the threat posed by North Korea Mr Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have but not that he supports them having those weapons said Trump spokesman Steven Chung Here are some of Trumps key comments about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons March 27 2016 The New York Times asked Trump if hed object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons given their proximity to North Korea Trump responded At some point we cannot be the policeman of the world And unfortunately we have a nuclear world now And you have Pakistan has them You have probably North Korea has them And would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also You may very well be better off if thats the case In other words where Japan is defending itself against North Korea which is a real problem He added later in the same interview If Japan had that nuclear threat Im not sure that would be a bad thing for us March 29 2016 CNNs Anderson Cooper asked Trump If youre concerned about proliferation letting other countries get nuclear weapons isnt that proliferation As part of a winding response Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation No no not proliferation I hate nuclear more than any I dont want more nuclear weapons and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first timeht',\n",
